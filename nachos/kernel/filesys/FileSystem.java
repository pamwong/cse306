// FileSystem.java
//	Interface to a Nachos file system.
//
//	A file system is a set of files stored on disk, organized
//	into directories.  Operations on the file system have to
//	do with "naming" -- creating, opening, and deleting files,
//	given a textual file name.  Operations on an individual
//	"open" file (read, write, close) are to be found in the OpenFile
//	class (openfile.h).
//
//	We define two separate implementations of the file system. 
//	This version is a "real" file system, built on top of 
//	a disk simulator.  The disk is simulated using the native UNIX 
//	file system (in a file named "DISK"). 
//
//	In the "real" implementation, there are two key data structures used 
//	in the file system.  There is a single "root" directory, listing
//	all of the files in the file system; unlike UNIX, the baseline
//	system does not provide a hierarchical directory structure.  
//	In addition, there is a bitmap for allocating
//	disk sectors.  Both the root directory and the bitmap are themselves
//	stored as files in the Nachos file system -- this causes an interesting
//	bootstrap problem when the simulated disk is initialized.
