This directory contains a variety of user programs useful for testing
the various Nachos subsystems developed in Assignments 2-4.

	All of the tests which use the "Exec" system call assume that the
executable for the child process is in the current working directory. The
easiest way to accomplish this is to create a link in this director to the
nachos executable you are using, and then run all of the tests from here.
	
	The tests in this directory can be built with either of two linker
scripts. The default is script_continuous for the userprog project. It simply
places the code, data, and stack contiguously in memory starting at address 0.

	For the VM assignment, you may want to use script_segmented to
implement segmented paging. Following are the specifications, taken from a
newsgroup post on the subject:


A user program has a 32-bit address space, split into 4 30-bit segments.

* Segment 00 is for code and read-only data (.text and .rdata)
* Segment 01 is for writable data (.data and .bss)
* Segment 10 is unused
* Segment 11 is for the stack

With this model you could think of using a scheme where you have a separate
page table for each segment and your translation code switches on the 
top two bits of the address to be translated to decide which page table to use.
